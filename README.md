# StonesC-SharpLR-Projects
Projects for Practicing and Learning

* AOSE_Csharp - is a skills emulator project ive been working on since started learning C# 6 months to a year ago; it works to calculate trickledown and spent IP-points isnt a problem but i have to get each class of character's (starting skill and abillity points) to make a formula that will be more useful.
  I also added for (a future) addition the tabcontrol for the Wear Window where items and armor can be selected from a database but I dont know how all that stuff works yet and i dont know where im going to get a database of all the items, I did try some parser for the AO-DB but i couldnt get it working.
  -------If you have suggestions Feel free to offer!
